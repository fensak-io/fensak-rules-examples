# Fensak Rules Examples

This repository contains examples of auto-approve rules for Fensak. Each folder represents an example use case and
contains:

    - `rules.js` or `rules.ts` containing the implementation of an auto-approve rule.
    - `required_rules.js` or `required_rules.ts` containing the implementation of a required rule.
